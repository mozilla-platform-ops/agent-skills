  Diagnose why a Taskcluster worker pool queue is backed up. Checks pool health
  (pending tasks, capacity, provisioning errors) via Taskcluster CLI and analyzes
  demand patterns (queue times, task volume by project, top pushers) via BigQuery.
  Produces a diagnostic summary identifying demand-side vs supply-side causes.
  Use whenever a worker pool has high pending counts, elevated queue times, or
  deadline-exceeded expirations. Also use when someone asks "why is the queue
  backed up", "why are tasks waiting", "what's wrong with <pool>", or mentions
  pending task counts for any gecko-t or releng-hardware pool.

# Queue Diagnosis

Diagnose why a Taskcluster worker pool queue is backed up by combining
real-time pool status from Taskcluster with historical demand analysis from
BigQuery.

## Arguments

The pool ID in `provisioner/worker-type` format (e.g., `gecko-t/win11-64-25h2`).

Both cloud pools (e.g., `gecko-t/win11-64-25h2`) and hardware pools (e.g.,
`releng-hardware/win11-64-24h2-hw`) are supported. Hardware pools have limited
supply-side data because they are not managed by Taskcluster worker-manager.

## How to use

Run the diagnostic script. It gathers all data in parallel and produces a
structured report:

```bash
uv run scripts/diagnose.py <pool-id>
```

Example:
```bash
uv run scripts/diagnose.py gecko-t/win11-64-25h2
```

The script outputs a JSON report with six sections: `pool_status`,
`queue_times`, `daily_volume`, `top_pushers`, `top_task_groups`, and
`links`. Read the output and present a diagnostic summary to the user.

Every claim in the summary must have a clickable link so the user can
verify it. The report provides these automatically.

## Interpreting results

### Hardware pools (releng-hardware)

Hardware pools (provisioner `releng-hardware`) are not managed by Taskcluster
worker-manager. The worker-manager APIs return 404 for these pools, so the
`pool_status` section will not include capacity, provider, or provisioning
error data. Supply-side analysis is limited to the queue pending count (from
the queue API) and BigQuery task run data (queue times, volume, expirations).
For hardware pool supply issues, check the physical machine fleet status
outside of this tool.

### Supply-side problems (infrastructure)

Look at the `pool_status` section (cloud/managed pools only).

**`warnings` vs `notes`:**
- **`warnings`** fires only when stuck workers are actively blocking demand:
  high stopping_pct AND pending tasks AND near-max capacity. Always surface
  these prominently — they indicate real supply-side pain.
- **`notes`** describes unusual state that isn't currently urgent. A pool
  with 0 pending and 0 running but 100% stopping is draining between
  shifts, not blocked. Mention it but don't treat it as a crisis.

**Signal fields:**
- `running_plus_requested` — workers actually doing or about to do work.
  This is the number shown as "running" in the TC worker-manager UI. When
  diagnosing, this is the capacity the pool actually has today.
- `current_capacity` — TC's internal counter = running + requested +
  stopping. Worker-manager uses this (not running_plus_requested) to
  decide whether to provision more workers. A pool can show
  `current_capacity` near `max_capacity` while almost nothing is actually
  running, because stopping workers are still counted. A large gap
  between `running_plus_requested` and `current_capacity` is the ghost
  signature: TC is accounting for workers that no longer exist, and the
  provisioner is refusing to scale up because it thinks the pool is
  already at the cap.
- `running_pct_of_max` — `running_plus_requested / max_capacity`. If this
  is low (e.g. 10%) while `capacity_headroom_pct` is also near 0, the
  pool is blocked on ghosts, not at real capacity.
- `stopping_pct` — fraction of currentCapacity in 'stopping'. Healthy spot
  churn is under ~10%; 30%+ is unusual regardless of urgency.
- `oldest_stopping_age_minutes` — how long the oldest stopping worker has
  been stuck. Normal spot eviction cleanup is <30 min; >60 min means
  worker-manager likely can't reap them. This is a strong signal that
  cloud VMs are gone but TC is still tracking them.
- `capacity_headroom` / `capacity_headroom_pct` — how many more workers
  worker-manager could request before hitting maxCapacity, based on
  `current_capacity`. Low headroom with pending tasks is the "can't
  scale up" signal.
- `error_stats_7d.total` and `.by_title` / `.by_code` — authoritative
  per-pool error counts over 7 days from `workerPoolErrorStats`. Use
  this for trend reasoning.
- `errors_by_title` / `errors_by_description` / `errors_by_region` —
  counts from the most recent page of `listWorkerPoolErrors`. Useful for
  identifying dominant failure modes (preempted vs OS-timeout vs quota)
  and whether they concentrate in specific Azure regions.

**Other supply-side issues to check:**
- **High error count relative to running workers** — provisioning failures
  are preventing scale-up. Check `errors_by_title` and
  `errors_by_description` for patterns (quota exhaustion, image failures,
  deployment conflicts). Discount `OperationPreempted` entries — those
  are normal spot churn noise, not real failures.
- **Running workers well below max_capacity despite pending tasks** — cloud
  provider can't fulfill requests, or ghosts are blocking scale-up.
  Compare `running_plus_requested` with `current_capacity` to decide
  which.
- **OS provisioning timeouts** — the bootstrap script is slow. Often happens
  under load or in specific regions. Look for concentration in
  `errors_by_region`.

**When ghosts are suspected**, cross-reference TC worker IDs against actual
cloud VMs. For Azure pools with resource groups named
`rg-tc-<provisioner>-<worker-type>`:

```bash
# Get TC stopping worker IDs
taskcluster api workerManager listWorkersForWorkerPool <pool-id> |
  jq -r '.workers[] | select(.state=="stopping") | .workerId' | sort > /tmp/tc.txt

# Get actual Azure VM names
az vm list --resource-group rg-tc-<pool> --query "[].name" -o tsv | sort > /tmp/az.txt

# Count ghosts (TC workers with no matching Azure VM)
comm -23 /tmp/tc.txt /tmp/az.txt | wc -l
```

Common spot pool errors that are NOT problems:
- "Operation execution has been preempted by a more recent operation" — normal
  spot VM lifecycle
- Concurrent request conflicts — Azure ARM template race conditions, self-healing

### Demand-side problems (too many tasks)

Look at `daily_volume` and `top_pushers`:

- **Task volume 2-3x above recent baseline** — the pool is healthy but
  overwhelmed. Compare current day to the same weekday last week.
- **`try` project dominating** — developer try pushes or automated sync bots
  (wptsync, phabricator) flooding the pool. Try tasks are lower priority but
  still consume capacity.
- **`autoland` spike** — high landing rate, often tied to release cycles.
  Check for `elm`, `maple`, `mozilla-beta`, or `mozilla-release` activity as
  signals of an active merge/release.
- **Single pusher with disproportionate volume** — one person or bot submitting
  thousands of tasks. Worth flagging.
- **Deadline expirations (expired_count)** — tasks that never got picked up
  before their deadline. If > 2-3% of total, the pool is seriously behind.

### Presenting the diagnosis

Structure the summary as:

1. **Current pool state** — pending, running, capacity utilization %. Link to
   the pool in TC using the `links.worker_pool` URL.
2. **Queue time impact** — median, p90, p95, max (convert ms to human-readable)
3. **Root cause** — demand-side, supply-side, or both, with evidence
4. **Top contributors** — which projects and pushers are driving volume. For
   each major contributor, include their largest task group links from
   `top_task_groups`. Each entry has `tc_url` (Taskcluster task group view)
   and `treeherder_url` (Treeherder job view).
5. **Trend** — is this getting better or worse (compare daily volumes)

Every top contributor and task group mentioned must have a clickable link.
The `top_task_groups` section provides both `tc_url` and `treeherder_url`
for each task group. Present these as markdown links so the user can click
through and verify.

**Example output format:**

```
wptsync@mozilla.com — 4,330 tasks across 117 groups (try)
  Largest group: [TC](https://firefox-ci-tc..../tasks/groups/Q1uV...) |
  [Treeherder](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/jobs?repo=try&taskGroupId=Q1uV...)
  641 tasks, median queue 56 min, max 2h 42min
```

### Drilling deeper with treeherder-cli

Once you've identified a problematic task group, use `treeherder-cli` for
follow-up investigation when you have the push revision (not the task group
ID). `treeherder-cli` works with revision hashes, not task group IDs.

```bash
# Check failures for a specific revision on autoland
treeherder-cli <revision> --repo autoland --json

# Filter to a specific platform
treeherder-cli <revision> --repo autoland --platform "windows.*25h2" --json

# Compare two revisions to find what changed
treeherder-cli <rev1> --compare <rev2> --json
```

Use this when you need to understand whether a specific push introduced
failures or regressions, not just that it consumed pool capacity.

## Authentication

The script calls two external services. Both must be authenticated before
the skill can run.

### Taskcluster

The `taskcluster` CLI must be configured with credentials that have read
access to the worker-manager and queue APIs. Authentication is set via
environment variables:

- `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` — must be `https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com`
- `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID` — your Taskcluster client ID
- `TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` — your Taskcluster access token

These are typically configured in your shell profile or via
`taskcluster signin`. Verify with:

```bash
taskcluster api workerManager workerPool gecko-t/win11-64-25h2
```

### Redash (BigQuery)

The Redash queries require an API key for `sql.telemetry.mozilla.org`:

- `REDASH_API_KEY` — your personal Redash API key

To get a key: log in to [sql.telemetry.mozilla.org](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org),
go to your profile (top-right menu), and copy the API key. Verify with:

```bash
uv run ~/.claude/skills/redash/scripts/query_redash.py --sql "SELECT 1 AS test"
```

### Runtime dependencies

- `taskcluster` CLI (install via `pip install taskcluster` or download binary)
- `uv` (install via `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- Redash skill installed at `~/.claude/skills/redash`

## Manual queries

If the script fails or you need to dig deeper, see `references/queries.md`
for the individual SQL queries you can run via the Redash skill.
