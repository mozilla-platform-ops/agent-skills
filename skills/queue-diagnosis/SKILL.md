  Diagnose why a Taskcluster worker pool queue is backed up. Checks pool health
  (pending tasks, capacity, provisioning errors) via Taskcluster CLI and analyzes
  demand patterns (queue times, task volume by project, top pushers) via BigQuery.
  Produces a diagnostic summary identifying demand-side vs supply-side causes.
  Use whenever a worker pool has high pending counts, elevated queue times, or
  deadline-exceeded expirations. Also use when someone asks "why is the queue
  backed up", "why are tasks waiting", "what's wrong with <pool>", or mentions
  pending task counts for any gecko-t or releng-hardware pool.

# Queue Diagnosis

Diagnose why a Taskcluster worker pool queue is backed up by combining
real-time pool status from Taskcluster with historical demand analysis from
BigQuery.

## Arguments

The pool ID in `provisioner/worker-type` format (e.g., `gecko-t/win11-64-25h2`).

Both cloud pools (e.g., `gecko-t/win11-64-25h2`) and hardware pools (e.g.,
`releng-hardware/win11-64-24h2-hw`) are supported. Hardware pools have limited
supply-side data because they are not managed by Taskcluster worker-manager.

## How to use

Run the diagnostic script. It gathers all data in parallel and produces a
structured report:

```bash
uv run scripts/diagnose.py <pool-id>
```

Example:
```bash
uv run scripts/diagnose.py gecko-t/win11-64-25h2
```

The script outputs a JSON report with six sections: `pool_status`,
`queue_times`, `daily_volume`, `top_pushers`, `top_task_groups`, and
`links`. Read the output and present a diagnostic summary to the user.

Every claim in the summary must have a clickable link so the user can
verify it. The report provides these automatically.

## Interpreting results

### Hardware pools (releng-hardware)

Hardware pools (provisioner `releng-hardware`) are not managed by Taskcluster
worker-manager. The worker-manager APIs return 404 for these pools, so the
`pool_status` section will not include capacity, provider, or provisioning
error data. Supply-side analysis is limited to the queue pending count (from
the queue API) and BigQuery task run data (queue times, volume, expirations).
For hardware pool supply issues, check the physical machine fleet status
outside of this tool.

### Supply-side problems (infrastructure)

Look at the `pool_status` section (cloud/managed pools only):

- **`warnings` list** — any entries here are supply-side issues the script
  detected automatically. Always surface these in the summary.
- **`stopping_pct` > 30%** — stopping workers are consuming capacity slots
  without running tasks. Normal spot churn is under 10%; 30%+ suggests ghost
  workers (VMs gone from the cloud but still tracked by TC) are blocking new
  provisioning.
- **`oldest_stopping_age_minutes` > 60** — healthy spot churn clears within
  ~30 min. Values beyond an hour suggest worker-manager cannot reap them.
  This is a strong signal of a ghost worker problem: the cloud VM is gone
  but TC still tracks the worker.
- **High error count relative to running workers** — provisioning failures are
  preventing scale-up. Check `errors` for patterns (quota exhaustion, image
  failures, deployment conflicts).
- **Running workers well below max_capacity despite pending tasks** — Azure
  can't fulfill requests. Could be regional quota limits, spot VM scarcity, or
  image issues.
- **OS provisioning timeouts** — the bootstrap script is slow. Often happens
  under load or in specific Azure regions.

When `warnings` or the two signals above fire together with high pending
tasks and low running count, the problem is supply-side capacity accounting,
not demand. Suggest cross-referencing TC worker IDs against actual cloud
VMs to count ghosts, and escalate to the team that owns worker-manager.

Common spot pool errors that are NOT problems:
- "Operation execution has been preempted by a more recent operation" — normal
  spot VM lifecycle
- Concurrent request conflicts — Azure ARM template race conditions, self-healing

### Demand-side problems (too many tasks)

Look at `daily_volume` and `top_pushers`:

- **Task volume 2-3x above recent baseline** — the pool is healthy but
  overwhelmed. Compare current day to the same weekday last week.
- **`try` project dominating** — developer try pushes or automated sync bots
  (wptsync, phabricator) flooding the pool. Try tasks are lower priority but
  still consume capacity.
- **`autoland` spike** — high landing rate, often tied to release cycles.
  Check for `elm`, `maple`, `mozilla-beta`, or `mozilla-release` activity as
  signals of an active merge/release.
- **Single pusher with disproportionate volume** — one person or bot submitting
  thousands of tasks. Worth flagging.
- **Deadline expirations (expired_count)** — tasks that never got picked up
  before their deadline. If > 2-3% of total, the pool is seriously behind.

### Presenting the diagnosis

Structure the summary as:

1. **Current pool state** — pending, running, capacity utilization %. Link to
   the pool in TC using the `links.worker_pool` URL.
2. **Queue time impact** — median, p90, p95, max (convert ms to human-readable)
3. **Root cause** — demand-side, supply-side, or both, with evidence
4. **Top contributors** — which projects and pushers are driving volume. For
   each major contributor, include their largest task group links from
   `top_task_groups`. Each entry has `tc_url` (Taskcluster task group view)
   and `treeherder_url` (Treeherder job view).
5. **Trend** — is this getting better or worse (compare daily volumes)

Every top contributor and task group mentioned must have a clickable link.
The `top_task_groups` section provides both `tc_url` and `treeherder_url`
for each task group. Present these as markdown links so the user can click
through and verify.

**Example output format:**

```
wptsync@mozilla.com — 4,330 tasks across 117 groups (try)
  Largest group: [TC](https://firefox-ci-tc..../tasks/groups/Q1uV...) |
  [Treeherder](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/jobs?repo=try&taskGroupId=Q1uV...)
  641 tasks, median queue 56 min, max 2h 42min
```

### Drilling deeper with treeherder-cli

Once you've identified a problematic task group, use `treeherder-cli` for
follow-up investigation when you have the push revision (not the task group
ID). `treeherder-cli` works with revision hashes, not task group IDs.

```bash
# Check failures for a specific revision on autoland
treeherder-cli <revision> --repo autoland --json

# Filter to a specific platform
treeherder-cli <revision> --repo autoland --platform "windows.*25h2" --json

# Compare two revisions to find what changed
treeherder-cli <rev1> --compare <rev2> --json
```

Use this when you need to understand whether a specific push introduced
failures or regressions, not just that it consumed pool capacity.

## Authentication

The script calls two external services. Both must be authenticated before
the skill can run.

### Taskcluster

The `taskcluster` CLI must be configured with credentials that have read
access to the worker-manager and queue APIs. Authentication is set via
environment variables:

- `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` — must be `https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com`
- `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID` — your Taskcluster client ID
- `TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` — your Taskcluster access token

These are typically configured in your shell profile or via
`taskcluster signin`. Verify with:

```bash
taskcluster api workerManager workerPool gecko-t/win11-64-25h2
```

### Redash (BigQuery)

The Redash queries require an API key for `sql.telemetry.mozilla.org`:

- `REDASH_API_KEY` — your personal Redash API key

To get a key: log in to [sql.telemetry.mozilla.org](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org),
go to your profile (top-right menu), and copy the API key. Verify with:

```bash
uv run ~/.claude/skills/redash/scripts/query_redash.py --sql "SELECT 1 AS test"
```

### Runtime dependencies

- `taskcluster` CLI (install via `pip install taskcluster` or download binary)
- `uv` (install via `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- Redash skill installed at `~/.claude/skills/redash`

## Manual queries

If the script fails or you need to dig deeper, see `references/queries.md`
for the individual SQL queries you can run via the Redash skill.
